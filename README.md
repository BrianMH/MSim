# Sim Framework

Wanted to test a few things out, so decided to make a sim framework to view a few metrics. I also wanted the harness to be as generic as possible so I can extend it in many other ways, but that will probably take some time to properly implement. For now, I just wanted to evaluate a simple framework.
